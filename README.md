### Hi! My Name is MikaelaðŸ‘‹


I am a Frontend developer with a couple years of experience. I studied at Noroff University in Oslo and I am looking for a job where I can work with what I love and enjoy. I chose frontend development because it's exciting and I can be creative, and also I get to learn new skills and take on new an different challenges. I enjoy being creative and building websites and applications, and I also have a strong interest in technology. Itâ€™s fun to see my ideas take shape on the screen and to explore new ways to engage and inspire users.

During my time at Noroff, I coded daily and completed tasks directly applicable to day-to-day work as a developer. Iâ€™ve developed strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and more, all essential for a successful career in tech. I also make projects on my spare time, and try to stay updated on whats new.
