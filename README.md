### Hi! My Name is MikaelaðŸ‘‹


I am a Frontend developer with two years of experience. I studied at Noroff University in Oslo and I am ready for an exciting career in this field. I chose frontend development because it's exciting and different from what I used to do. I enjoy being creative and building websites and applications, and I also have a strong interest in technology. Itâ€™s fun to see my ideas take shape on the screen and to explore new ways to engage and inspire users.

During my time at Noroff, I coded daily and completed tasks directly applicable to day-to-day work as a developer. Iâ€™ve developed strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and more, all essential for a successful career in tech.
